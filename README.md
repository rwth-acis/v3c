# Virtus Project

The “Virtual Vocational Education and Training – VIRTUS” project will develop an innovative, fully functional virtual vocational education and training centre, which will provide appropriately designed modular certified courses in Modular Employable Skills (MES), corresponding to a wide range of circumstances such as regional growth potential and/or company restructuring and aiming at increasing the participation rate of adult learners in vocational education and training.
